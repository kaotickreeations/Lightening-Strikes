A dynamic and interactive dashboard to track via NOAA, the number of lightening strikes in the US. Tools used: Tableau
Interactive Dashboard of Lightning Strikes Across the US (2009-2018)

Overview: The interactive dashboard visualizes lightning strike data across the United States from 2009 to 2018, showcasing trends and patterns over these years. The goal is to provide insights into the frequency and distribution of lightning strikes and how they have been increasing.

Components:

Map Visualization:

What It Shows: The map highlights the locations of lightning strikes across the US. Different colors represent the frequency of strikes in each region.

Purpose: It allows users to see which areas are most prone to lightning strikes. By visualizing the geographic distribution, users can identify regions with higher lightning activity.

Trend Line Chart:

What It Shows: This chart displays the number of lightning strikes each year from 2009 to 2018, revealing the trend of lightning activity.

Purpose: It helps users understand how lightning strikes have increased over time. The trend line makes it easy to see any upward or downward trends in the data.

Interactive Filters:

What They Do: These filters allow users to customize the view by selecting specific years, regions, or intensities of strikes.

Purpose: By using these filters, users can explore the data in more detail and focus on specific aspects that interest them. It enhances the interactivity and usability of the dashboard.

Tooltips and Annotations:

What They Show: When users hover over data points on the map or chart, additional information is displayed, such as the exact number of strikes and any notable events.

Purpose: Tooltips provide context and detailed information without cluttering the visualization. Annotations highlight significant trends or anomalies, making the data more informative and engaging.

Implications of the Trends Observed:

Public Safety: The increase in lightning strikes indicates a higher risk of injuries and fatalities. Awareness and preparedness can help mitigate these risks.

Infrastructure Impact: More frequent lightning activity can lead to increased damage to buildings, power lines, and other infrastructure. Enhancing lightning protection systems
can reduce these impacts.

Environmental Effects: Lightning strikes can cause wildfires, affecting ecosystems and air quality. Understanding these patterns can inform conservation efforts and climate change studies.

Economic Costs: Repair and maintenance costs due to lightning damage can be substantial. Preventive measures can lower long-term expenses.

Agriculture and Wildlife: Lightning can damage crops and harm wildlife. Protective measures can safeguard agricultural productivity and wildlife habitats. By visualizing and analyzing the data on lightning strikes from 2009 to 2018, the dashboard provides valuable insights that can inform public safety measures, infrastructure planning, environmental conservation, and more. It is a powerful tool for researchers, policymakers, and the general public to understand and respond to the increasing trend of lightning strikes across the US
